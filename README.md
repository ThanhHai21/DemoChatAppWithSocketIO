# Chat App for Android using Socket.io - Beginner's Guide
## Introduction

In this beginner's guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating a simple chat application for Android using Socket.io. Socket.io is a popular library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client (in our case, the Android app) and the server. We will build a basic chat app where users can send and receive messages in real-time.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development machine:

- Android Studio (latest version)
- Basic understanding of Android development and kolin programming
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine for setting up the server (backend)

## Note: open internet access in file AndroidManifest.xml

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

## Conclusion

This app allows real-time communication between multiple devices using a server as an intermediary. Feel free to enhance the app with additional features like user authentication, message history, or user avatars. Happy coding!
